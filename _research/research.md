## Colloidal Self-Assembly
Globally ordered colloidal crystal lattices have broad utility in a wide range of optical and catalytic devices, for example, as photonic band gap materials. However, the self-assembly of stereospecific structures is often confounded by polymorphism. Small free-energy differences often characterize ensembles of different structures, making it difficult to produce a single morphology at will. Current techniques to handle this problem adopt one of two approaches: that of the "top-down" or "bottom-up" methodology, whereby structures are engineered starting from the largest or smallest relevant length scales, respectively. However, recently my work has focused on developing a new methodology for controlling **[colloidal crystal assembly](/_research/sdacolloids/)** and polymorphism using external structure-directing agents.  To this end, special attention has been paid to designing computational algorithms for predicting crystal polymorphism and the relative stability of **[multicomponent colloidal mixtures](/_research/multicolloids)**.

## Computational Methods for Data-driven Thermodynamics
With the advent of the [fourth paradigm of science](https://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/EBOOKS/M091000H.pdf) ("big data"), data-intensive, if not data-driven, approaches are proving to be novel, effective tools for scientific inquiry.  In contrast to the previous paradigm ("computational"), for many areas of research, data-driven approaches rely less on small amounts of very accurate data in favor of larger amounts of "reasonably accurate" data to learn things about the natural world.  In the field of chemical thermodynamics, a large body of work has emerged over the past half century describing highly accurate, but often computationally intensive, simulation tools for investigating the thermodynamic behavior of fluids.  Central to this is the focus on increasingly complex schemes to provide more accurate calculations regardless of the expense.  Such solutions do not scale well when trying to investigate a wide range of systems or cases.  My work focuses on revisiting early ideas from the field of statistical mechanics, and developing some new ones, to create **[fast, approximate methods](/_research/highthroughput/)** that permit high-throughput, data-driven investigation of the thermodynamic properties of fluids, as well as predicting complex, **[alchemical transformations](/_research/alchemy/)**.

## Alternative Separation Technologies
Chemical separations in the manufacturing industry account for as much as [15% of global energy use](https://www.nature.com/news/seven-chemical-separations-to-change-the-world-1.19799), and as much as half of the industrial energy used in the U.S. While porous mass separating agents (MSAs) appear to be one plausible lower energy alternative, the lack of certain fundamental relationships between the behavior of fluid mixtures confined in porous materials and the selectivity of MSA-based processes presents a significant barrier to their widespread industrial application. Reducing the energy required to achieve separation of industrially-relevant fluids is essential to ensuring the sustainability of the chemical manufacturing sector.  In collaboration with the American Chemical Society's Green Chemistry Institute Chemical Manufacturers Roundtable, my work focuses on developing theoretical and computational tools which will help accelerate the industrial application of less energy-intensive **[chemical separation](/_research/adsorption/)** alternatives to distillation.  Most of the efforts by myself and coworkers is focused on understanding fundamental aspects of outstanding questions in adsorption-based MSA processes in order to enable the rational design of such processes in the future.
